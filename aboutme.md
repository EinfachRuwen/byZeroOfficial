
## ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am byZero.
I am byZero and I am a young developer and student. Currently I go to a secondary school near Bielefeld, Germany. I know the basics in many programming languages like a bit of HTML, PHP, Shell, JavaScript. I'm trying to learn web development in the near future so I can create my own websites :)
## ðŸ“š My Story
When I was 6 or 7 I often had the interest to program my own messenger app and in those years I often searched on Google for websites to program apps, but I never found a really good website. At some point I searched on the Play Store and found Sketchware. Sketchware is an app with a drag-and-drop editor, so you can build apps like putting Lego bricks together. At first I made apps with a simple button that had no real function, but eventually I made my first good apps like a substitution schedule app for my old school that kept evolving. Eventually I wanted a computer and a few months later my parents paid for my own Minecraft server. That's how I got in touch with Wordpress, HTML, PHP and CSS. In 2020, I rented a Linux root server on which I continued the Minecraft server and also further developed the substitution plan app. In February 2021 I made my first repositories on GitHub and rewrote the full Vertretungsplan app and wrote PHP scripts on my webspace. Not much more has happened yet, but I will write more here when something new happens.
## âœˆ What's next?
In the near future I'm thinking about learning PHP, HTML, CSS and Node.js so I can create my own websites and get ahead. I plan to maybe start my own developer company later, but of course I'm still thinking a lot about it.
